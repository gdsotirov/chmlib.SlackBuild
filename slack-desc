chmlib: CHM lib - Library for dealing with Microsoft ITSS/CHM files
chmlib:
chmlib: CHMLIB is a library for dealing with Microsoft ITSS/CHM format files.
chmlib: Right now, it is a very simple library, but sufficient for dealing
chmlib: with all of the .chm files Due to the fairly well-designed indexing
chmlib: built into this particular file format, even a small library is able
chmlib: to gain reasonably good performance indexing into ITSS archives.
