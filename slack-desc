chmlib:
chmlib: CHMLIB is a library for dealing with Microsoft ITSS/CHM format files.
chmlib: Right now, it is a very simple library, but sufficient for dealing with
chmlib: all of the .chm files Due to the fairly well-designed indexing built
chmlib: into this particular file format, even a small library is able to gain
chmlib: reasonably good performance indexing into ITSS archives.
